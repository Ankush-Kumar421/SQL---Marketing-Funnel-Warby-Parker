# Marketing Funnel with Warby Parker - SQL

This project is part of the Codecademy course on SQL. In this project, I analyzed different Warby Parker's marketing funnels to calculate conversion rates. The following files are:
1.	Powerpoint presentation – Contains my analysis is communicated to the audience.
2.	Excel file – Contains my detailed analysis in tables and graphs forms.
3.	SQL file – Contains my queries are used in generating the data to be analyzed.
4.	Database file (.sqlite) – Contains the actual data.
Note that the database file (.sqlite) can be opened by using the "DB Browser." Then you can copy and paste the queries file (SQL file) in the "Execute SQL" tab of the "DB Browser" to see the results of each query.
