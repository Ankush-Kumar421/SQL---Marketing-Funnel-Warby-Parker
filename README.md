This project is part of Codecademy course on SQL. 
In this project, I analyzed different Warby Parkerâ€™s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates.
There are three files:
  1) Powerpoint presentation - My analysis being communicated to the audience.
  2) The excel file - My detail analysis in tables and graphs.
  3) The SQL file - My queries we generated in SQL to extract the data.
