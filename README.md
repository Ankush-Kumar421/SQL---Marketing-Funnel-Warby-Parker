# Marketing Funnel with Warby Parker - SQL

This project is part of the Codecademy course on SQL. In this project, I analyzed different Warby Parker's marketing funnels to calculate conversion rates. The following files are:
1.	PowerPoint presentation – It contains my analysis in the presentation form.
2.	Excel file – It includes my detailed analysis in tables and graphs forms.
3. SQL file – Contains my queries used in generating the data to be analyzed.

Note that the actual data used is not available. The SQL file contains the programming code used to create the queries. Initially, the queries were created using SQLite format, but I converted it to the SQL format. This file can be opened using Sublime Text.
